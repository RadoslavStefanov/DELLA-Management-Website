# Della-Management-Website

I was hired by a commercial cleaning company to recreate and modernize their old site. This is the project that accomplishes just that.

For this job there were these requirements:

Users must have an easy way to any product the firm offers.
The pictures were to be fully licensed.
The website was required to work on most types of screens/devices/browsers.
The site needed a completely new design.
All the pages for the products should follow a commong design language.
Form Captcha protection.
A "ThankYou" page with a timer.
SEO Optimization
Price calculator for private clients ... and much more...
To achieve the template/design freedom we needed, I decided to create the project using the vanilla tools like HTML/CSS/JS and build this site from the ground up.

Here are a few pictures of the project at the moment:
